# Physical Layer Devices

## Repeater

- A repeater operates at the physical layer.
- Its job is to regenerate the signal over the same network before the signal becomes too weak or corrupted so as to extend the length to which the signal can be transmitted over the same network.
- An important point to be noted about repeaters is that they do not amplify the signal.
- When the signal becomes weak, they copy the signal bit by bit and regenerate it at the original strength.
- It is a 2 port device.

## Hub

- A hub is basically a multiport repeater.
- A hub connects multiple wires coming from different branches, for example, the connector in star topology which connects different stations.
- Hubs cannot filter data, so data packets are sent to all connected devices.
- Transmission mode is half duplex.
- Also, they do not have the intelligence to find out the best path for data packets which leads to inefficiencies and wastage.

### Types of Hub

#### Active Hub

These are the hubs that have their own power supply and can clean, boost, and relay the signal along with the network.

Active hubs amplify and regenerate the incoming electrical signals before broadcasting them

#### Passive Hub

These are the hubs that collect wiring from nodes and power supply from the active hub.

Can't be used to extend the distance between nodes.

#### Intelligent Hub

- It works like active hubs and includes remote management capabilities.
- They also provide flexible data rates to network devices.
- It also enables an administrator to monitor the traffic passing through the hub and to configure each port in the hub.
