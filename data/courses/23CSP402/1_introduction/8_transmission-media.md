# Transmission Media

A transmission medium can be broadly defined as anything that can carry information from a source to a destination

## Twisted-Pair Cable

- A twisted pair consists of two conductors (normally copper), each with its own plastic insulation, twisted together.
- One of the wires is used to carry signals to the receiver, and the other is used only as a ground reference. The receiver uses the difference between the two.
- Noise and crosstalk may affect both wires and create unwanted signals.
- In one twist, one wire is closer to the noise source and the other is farther; in the next twist, the reverse is true.
- Twisting makes it probable that both wires are equally affected by external influences (noise or crosstalk).
- This means that the receiver, which calculates the difference between the two, receives no unwanted signals. The unwanted signals are mostly canceled out.
- The number of twists per unit of length (e.g., inch) has some effect on the quality of the cable.

- The most common twisted-pair cable used in communications is referred to as unshielded twisted-pair (utp). IBM has also produced a version of twisted-pair cable for its use called shielded twisted-pair (STP).
- The most common UTP connector is RJ45 (RJ stands for registered jack)
- Twisted-pair cables are used in telephone lines to provide voice and data channels. Local-area networks also use twisted-pair cables.

## Coaxial Cable

- Coaxial cable (or coax) carries signals of higher frequency ranges than those in twisted pair cable.
- Instead of having two wires, coax has a central core conductor of solid or stranded wire (usually copper) enclosed in an insulating sheath, which is, in turn, encased in an outer conductor of metal foil, braid, or a combination of the two.
- The outer metallic wrapping serves both as a shield against noise and as the second conductor, which completes the circuit.
- This outer conductor is also enclosed in an insulating sheath, and the whole cable is protected by a plastic cover.
- Coaxial cables are categorized by their radio government (RG) ratings.
- To connect coaxial cable to devices, we need coaxial connectors. The most common type of connector used today is the BayoneNeill-Concelman (BNC) connector.
- Coaxial cable was widely used in analog telephone networks.
- Cable TV networks also use coaxial cables.
- Another common application of coaxial cable is in traditional Ethernet LANs

| Category | Impedance | Use            |
| -------- | --------- | -------------- |
| RG-59    | 75 &ohm;  | Cable TV       |
| RG-58    | 50 &ohm;  | Thin Ethernet  |
| RG-11    | 50 &ohm;  | Thick Ethernet |

## Fiber-Optic Cable

- A fiber-optic cable is made of glass or plastic and transmits signals in the form of light.
- Optical fibers use reflection to guide light through a channel. A glass or plastic core is surrounded by a cladding of less dense glass or plastic
- Current technology supports two modes (multimode and single mode) for propagating light along optical channels, each requiring fiber with different physical characteristics.
- Multimode can be implemented in two forms: step-index or graded-index.

- There are three types of connectors for fiber-optic cables
- The subscriber channel (sC) connector is used for cable TV. It uses a push/pull locking system. The straight-tip (ST) connector is used for connecting cable to networking devices. It uses a bayonet locking system and is more reliable than SC. MT-RJ is a connector that is the same size as RJ45.
- Fiber-optic cable is often found in backbone networks because its wide bandwidth is cost-effective.
- Some cable TV companies use a combination of optical fiber and coaxial cable
- Local-area networks such as 1o0Base-Fx network (Fast Ethernet) and 1000Base-X also use fiber-optic cable.

Advantages:

- Higher bandwidth
- Less signal attenuation
- Immunity to electromagnetic interference.
- Resistance to corrosive materials.
- Light weight.
- Greater immunity to tapping.

Disadvantages:

- Installation and maintenance
- Unidirectional light propagation
- Cost
