		The Archive Project aims to be a clean, centralized, and durable archive of academic
		resources for college students—gathered from scattered sources and reorganized for easier
		access, reading, and studying.

	<p>
		The Archive Project is a community-hosted system for organizing study materials in a way
		that respects the user's time, attention, and privacy. It gathers PDFs, images (even
		handwritten ones), YouTube links, and plain text files into a structured archive that is
		searchable and readable.
	</p>
	<p>
		The focus is not just on storing documents, but on making them usable. Instead of flipping
		through a 60-page PDF or zooming into a blurry image, users can read content in clean
		Markdown, view as slides, bookmark sections, and generate flashcards or quizzes based on the
		material itself.
	</p>
	<p>No signups. No gamification. No noise.</p>

	<p>
		This is not a social platform. There are no accounts, comments, feeds, or followers. It’s
		not a product, either—there are no ads, no analytics, and no "engagement features." You will
		not be nudged to come back or given notifications. It's a tool that works when you need it,
		and stays quiet when you don't.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is not trying to replace classes or teachers. It's a complement to the messy but valuable
		ecosystem of shared files that already exists—just with a better way to navigate and read
		them.
