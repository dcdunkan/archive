# The Archive Project

</div>

_The Archive Project_ is a **no-nonsense, community-managed** platform that provides free and open courses and resources.
The project aims to be a clean, centralized, and durable archive of academic resources for college students—gathered from scattered sources by students and reorganized for easier access, reading, and studying.

It does not intend to replace classes or teachers.
It's a complement to the messy but valuable ecosystem of shared files that already exists—just with a better way to navigate and read them.

The project was started for digitalising scattered resources such as PDFs that are unorganized, mixed and duplicated, presentations, documents, YouTube videos and playlists, figures and question papers.
The original aim was to enable full-text search on all the documents, for finding portions and related notes and questions easily.
And more ideas were eventually built on to it.

This repository contains the source code for the official _The Archive Project_ web client.

> More documentation regarding development and contribution to be added soon.
